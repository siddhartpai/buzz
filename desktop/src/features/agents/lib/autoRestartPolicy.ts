 * Chunk F auto-restart policy — the pure decision core.
 *
 * SAFETY-CRITICAL: the stop command is SIGTERM → ≤1s → SIGKILL with no
 * in-process drain, so this predicate is the ONLY thing standing between
 * the policy loop and killing a mid-turn agent. Every never-fire condition
 * below is load-bearing; the test matrix enumerates them exhaustively.
 *
 * Scope: the stop/start commands the loop fires are pair-scoped to the
 * active community, and `needsRestart` reports drift for that same pair —
 * a fire bounces only the community being viewed, never an agent's pairs
 * in other communities.
 *
 * Decisions:
 * - "fire": restart now (all gates green, continuity window satisfied).
 * - "arm": conditions are green but the quiescence window is still
 *   accumulating — keep the timer running.
 * - "hold": some gate is red — reset any accumulated quiescence and show
 *   the badge only.
