//! Owner side of the NIP-AS spawner attestation handshake.
//!
//! A `buzz-spawner` daemon mints an agent's secret key on the server and never
//! transmits it. But a NIP-OA auth tag binds one specific agent pubkey and is
//! signed with the *owner's* secret key, so the spawner cannot self-attest — it
//! has to ask. This module is the answer to that question.
//!
//! # Security: the auth tag is a delegation, not a formality
//!
//! Signing an attestation admits that agent pubkey to the relay under **this
//! user's** membership. A malicious spawner that gets a signature can run an
//! agent that reads the user's channels. So:
//!
//! - The tag is computed only for the agent pubkey named in the *decrypted*
//!   frame, so a frame body cannot ask for a signature over some other key
//!   while displaying a benign one.
//! - The relocation key is looked up in this device's own store by that same
//!   pubkey, so a spawner cannot name an arbitrary key and be handed it.
//! - The response is NIP-44 encrypted back to the same spawner that asked, so
//!   an eavesdropper on the ephemeral kind:24201 stream gets ciphertext.
//!
//! ## Where the trust decision lives
//!
//! The consent prompt and the remembered set of approved spawners are the
//! renderer's (`features/agents/trustedSpawners.ts`), and the `trust` argument
//! here is that answer passed back in. This module does **not** re-derive it:
//! anything with IPC reach can therefore ask for a signature without a user
//! ever seeing a prompt, and the renderer is the boundary being relied on. That
//! is the same trust model as every other signing command in this app — the
//! webview is not treated as hostile — but it is worth stating plainly rather
//! than implying a backend check that does not exist.
